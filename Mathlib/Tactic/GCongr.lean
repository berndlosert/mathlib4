/-! # Setup for the `gcongr` tactic

The core implementation of the `gcongr` ("generalized congruence") tactic is in the file
`Tactic.GCongr.Core`.  In this file we set it up for use across the library by tagging a minimal
set of lemmas with the attribute `@[gcongr]` and by listing `positivity` as a first-pass
discharger for side goals (`gcongr_discharger`). -/
